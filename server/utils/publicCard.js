     Hiding it client-side still ships it over the wire, so anyone opening
     devtools sees every card's college regardless of the setting, and the
     toggle is a decoration rather than the privacy control it claims to be.
     Removing it at the projection means the data never leaves the database.

     whether people can see YOU, and says nothing about what you are allowed to
     see. Someone with the badge off is still shown college names on other
     people's cards. The `showCollege` flag itself is dropped either way — it is
